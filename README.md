# Henry House
I have always liked tech-related things be it hardware or software. I would be producing music for an
artist and often find that I was more interested in the recording software than the song. That curiosity
eventually led me to enroll in Nashville Software School! Through NSS, I was able to further explore my passion for technology and develop those skills to solve complex problems.

## Highlighted Work

### Algorithm Lair - Front-End Capstone

This website allows users to create lists of speedcubing algorithms, as well as keep a log of their solve times. It was completed as my capstone project at the end of the Front-End (Javascript/React/HTML/CSS) portion of my work at Nashville Software School.
