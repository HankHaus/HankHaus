### Algorithm Lair - Front-End Capstone
<br>
This website allows users to create lists of speedcubing algorithms, as well as keep a log of their solve times. It was completed as my capstone project at the end of the Front-End (Javascript/React/HTML/CSS) portion of my work at Nashville Software School.
